# Website for my [Founders & Coders](https://foundersandcoders.com/) application

## Brief 
This website was created as part of the application to the 16-week javascript fullstack course at Founder & Coders. The actual brief, described on the [list of prerequisites](https://foundersandcoders.com/apply/prerequisites/) states: Tell us something interesting about yourself that will support your application. The website has to be a one-page site.

## Idea 
To answer the brief, I wanted to share some facts about me that are relevant to the application and create a compelling experience for the user. I selected a few facts about myself and let the user guess true or false in response to each fact. The facts describe the journey from my hometown to my current location, where I have spent the past 8 years working in the communications industry, and highlights my previous pivots in discipline, ending on why my next one is to become a programmer.

## Execution
**Specs:** 
- The site was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

---

**One-page format:** 
- Although the website displays as multiple "screens" of changing content it is all contained in one HTML file separated by `<section>` tags

**One-page CSS styles:** 
- Each screen is confined in ` <section> ` tags and at any given time all but one section is hidden (`display: none;`)
- At the start only the first section (`data-name="index"`) is given a class that displays it (`.show`) 
- Each `<section>` has been given a `data-name` attribute as an id so that the one `.show` class can be reassigned  

---

**Navigation:** 
- Javascript code allows navigation to specific parts of the page after clicking a `<button>` element
- Navigation is achieved by matching the two data attributes so that each `<button>` element holds the exact id of the next `<section>`

**JavaScript navigation code:** 
- A list of all `<buttons>` is generated by grabbing all elements with a `data-target` attribute (`const links = document.querySelectorAll('[data-target]');`)
- The list is then looped through (`for (var i = 0; i < links.length; i++)`) and an event listener is added to each element in the loop (`links[i].addEventListener('click', function(e)`) 

The below is applied to each click event:
- The script identifies and stores the id of the one `<section>` that iscurrently displayed so that ultimately it can be hidden (`const currSection = document.querySelector('section.show');)`
- The `data-target` attribute stored in the `<button>` element is also identified and stored (`const nextSectionAttr = this.getAttribute('data-target')`) so that it can be the guide of where to go next
- To guide the navigation, the `data-target` is used to construct an id for the next `<section>` (`const nextSection = document.querySelector[data-name='+ nextSectionAttr +']`) 
- Finally, the `<section>` we want to navigate away from is hidden (`currSection.classList.remove('show');`) and the `<section>` we want to navigate to becomes visible (`nextSection.classList.add('show');`)

**Emojis:** 
- Hi-res images of the [emojis](https://emojipedia.org) were used in place of unicode emojis to ensure these deisplay on older platforms
